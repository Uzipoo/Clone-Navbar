# clone-navbar
 I have cloned a navbar using the concept of flex-box as I recently studied the concept and found it interesting.
 The website I used as as example is ultraedit and it is a website for different types pf text editors
 Website link: ultraedit.com
 I have used icons from the website link: hugeicons.com
 svg: <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" width="24" height="24" color="#000000" fill="none">
    <path d="M18 9.00005C18 9.00005 13.5811 15 12 15C10.4188 15 6 9 6 9" stroke="currentColor" stroke-width="1.5" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round" />
</svg>
